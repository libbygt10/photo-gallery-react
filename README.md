React Photo Gallery

This project is a photo gallery that I created using React. I used the following, among other things, in the making of the gallery:

- Functional Components
- Props
- NPM components to alter certain parts of the layout (example: react-image-resizer)
- Hard coded CSS

I plan to eventually go in and make this a larger project, but I am proud of where it is for the time being.
